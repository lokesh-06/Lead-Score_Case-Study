# Lead-Score_Case-Study
Project Overview:
In this project, we are assisting an education company, X Education, in improving its lead conversion rate. The company wishes to identify the most potential leads, or 'Hot Leads,' to increase the lead conversion rate from its current 30% to a target of around 80%. We will build a logistic regression model to assign lead scores between 0 and 100 to each lead, helping the sales team prioritize their efforts. The dataset provided contains various attributes such as Lead Source, Total Time Spent on Website, Total Visits, and Last Activity, among others. The target variable, 'Converted,' indicates whether a past lead was converted (1) or not (0).
Goals of the Case Study:
1) Build a logistic regression model to assign lead scores.
2) Address additional problems presented by the company using the logistic regression model.
3) Document the model's findings and recommendations.

Results Expected:
1) A well-commented Jupyter notebook containing:
2) Logistic regression model implementation.
3) Conversion predictions and evaluation metrics.
A Word document with solutions to additional problems presented by the company, based on the logistic regression model's output.
A presentation summarizing the project's approach and results, including:
 i) Problem statement and analysis approach.
ii) Explanation of results in business terms.
iii) Visualizations and key findings.
A brief summary report (500 words) explaining the assignment's progression and key takeaways.
